# EMI Assortments

An assortment of EMI addons that I have ported primarily for personal use but that I have decided to publish so others can enjoy whilst waiting for the upstream projects to port.

## Included Projects:
- [EMI Ores](https://github.com/Abbie5/emi-ores/) by Abbie5
- [EMI Trades](https://github.com/Prismwork/EMITrades/) by Prismwork and Flamarine
- [EMI Loot](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/EMI_loot/) by fzzyhmstrs and lxly9

## Note To Original Authors
Feel free to take any modifications I have made to your relevant codebases back under the license your codebase was.
I have to publish this work under the most restrictive which is LGPL-3.0

I'm sorry in advance for any difficulties adapting the changes back to the original codebase.
